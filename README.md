<p> So if you are a sys and ya ant younger then 15 come talk ta us <3</p>

  <p align="center"> INTRO </p>
  <p align="center"> The name is Knight/Neon or a fronters name. </p>
  <p align="center"> Yall are welcome to C+H and Int anytime!! </p>

  <p align="center"> Most of the time we wont blantly say we are a sys in our pt name, but we will always have this git conneted to the alter that is fronting. </p>

<p></p>

<p align="center"> (srry if thats confusing but i mean like if our 1x is fronting I will connet this git to the skin and if hes not fronting but i wanna use the skin then this wont be conneted! make sesne? :Sob:)</p>
